# code-quiz
A timed code quiz

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML/CSS powered by Javascript. 

When taking the code quiz, click to start and a timer begins. 

The user is then presented with a series of questions. 

As questions are answered, then another question is presented. 

When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, then the quiz is over and the user can save their initials and score.
