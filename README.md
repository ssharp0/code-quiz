A timed code quiz

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML/CSS powered by Javascript. 

When taking the code quiz, click to start and a timer begins. The timer is shown in the nav bar so the user can be aware of the time remaining. 

The user is then presented with a series of questions. The user will click on the choice to select their answer. The user will be notified of incorrect or correct choices. 

As questions are answered, then another question is presented. 

When a question is answered incorrectly, time (15 seconds) is subtracted from the clock.

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, then the quiz is over.

The user can see their score and save their initials and score. Initials and scores are saved to local storage. 

The user can view and/or clear the scoreboard, and retake the quiz and compare scores.
